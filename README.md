# CSE248 Final Project
Joshua Morris

For my project I chose to use Cloud Firestore, a product of Google's Firebase service.

Firebase is a BaaS (Backend-as-a-service) platform owned by Google. The purpose of Firebase is to allow developers to build 
web and mobile applications without having to manage servers or infrastructure, as it runs entirely on Google's cloud. Firebase can be
used to develop apps for various platforms including Android, iOS, and Web.

One of Firebase's most popular products is Cloud Firestore. Cloud Firestore is a NoSQL database. Unlike a traditon SQL database in which
data is stored in tables, Cloud Firestore stores its data as documents in the form of JSON. This allows Cloud Firestore to be more flexible
and scalable. Google provides native SDK's which allow Cloud Firestore to be easily accessed from any platform.

I chose Cloud Firestore for my project because it seemed like a good fit to store structured data such as user accounts and garage layouts.
In the real world, an app like this would have to be connected to the internet, so I felt it would it would be a good idea to get
experience connecting an app to an online database. I decided to integrate Firestore early in the project because I figured it would be more difficult to do so if I waited until the
end.
